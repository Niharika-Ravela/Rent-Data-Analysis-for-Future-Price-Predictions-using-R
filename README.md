Singapore Real-Estate House Prices
The data was gathered and collected by keeping a track of transactions 
done by the private residential properties in between the years 1995 and 
2015 from the Urban Redevelopment Authority Real Estate Information 
System (REALIS). It was mainly concentrated on the Singapore’s residential 
housing market. Some of the features that were recorded in the data 
collection are the type of the project (whether it is a loft, suite, finished, 
unfinished, and many others), longitudinal and latitudinal location of the 
project, completion year of the project, contract year, size, number of 
floors, area in sqm, building height, how far it is to a mall, if it has facilities 
like gym, pool, tennis court and others.
It is said that the Singapore’s residential market is classified into three types: 
Apartments (high buildings) by Housing and Development Board 
(government), Apartments (high-rise buildings) by private developers, and 
semi implemented buildings by private developers.
